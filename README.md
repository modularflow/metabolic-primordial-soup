# BFF Primordial Soup Simulation

A high-performance GPU-accelerated implementation of self-modifying program soups, derived from the research on computational life and emergent self-replicators. This project is 100% "vibe" coded in rust because rust forces a lot of guardrails that the original in c++ does not. I don't know what I don't know, so I'd rather this be safe (not to wacky things with memory) and user friendly (a simple binary and yaml files without having to mess around with compiling c++ or making the python bindings work).

## Overview

This project simulates a "primordial soup" of programs that can interact, mutate, and potentially evolve self-replicating behavior. Programs are written in BFF (Brainfuck Family), a minimal instruction set that supports:

- Two read/write heads operating on a shared tape
- Copy operations between program pairs
- Random mutations
- 2D toroidal grid topology for spatial structure

The simulation includes an optional **energy system** that creates localized zones where mutation is permitted, adding evolutionary pressure and spatial dynamics. The intent is to see if our replicators can compute logic of the underlying simulation as a means to survive. If the hypothesis is feasible through running the simulation, I believe this method can be expanded to other simulations of our world that can lead to new ways of evolving artifical intelligence architectures, rather than pre-determining  them. 


## Inspirations

This implementation is directly derived from the paper:

The "energy" portion of this implementation is also inspired by research done on slime mould and its evolved thermodynamic computing capabilities.

## Background

This Rust implementation provides:
- GPU acceleration via CUDA (NVIDIA, fastest, no buffer limits) or wgpu (Vulkan/Metal, cross-platform)
- Batched parallel simulations (run multiple seeds simultaneously)
- Mega-simulation mode (parallel sims arranged in a grid with cross-border interaction)
- Configurable energy zones with variable shapes for spatial evolutionary dynamics
- Simulation groups for comparative experiments with different evolutionary pressures
- Checkpointing for saving and resuming simulations
- Async raw data saving for maximum simulation speed
- Post-simulation frame rendering
- YAML configuration files
- Video generation from simulation frames

## Requirements

- Rust 1.70+
- GPU with Vulkan, Metal, or CUDA support (for GPU acceleration)
- ffmpeg (for video generation)

### Compute Backends

The simulation supports three compute backends, configurable via the `backend` field in config.yaml:

| Backend | Requirements | Buffer Limit | Performance |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| `cuda` | NVIDIA GPU + CUDA toolkit | None (full GPU memory) | Fastest |
| `wgpu` | Any GPU with Vulkan/Metal | 4GB per buffer | Good |
| `cpu` | None | System RAM | Slow (fallback) |

For NVIDIA GPUs, CUDA is recommended as it has no buffer size limits and is typically faster. For AMD, Intel, or Apple GPUs, wgpu provides cross-platform support via Vulkan or Metal.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modularflow/energetic-primordial-soup.git
cd energetic-primordial-soup

# For NVIDIA GPUs (recommended - fastest, no buffer limits)
cargo build --release --features cuda

# For cross-platform GPU (Vulkan/Metal - works on AMD, Intel, Apple)
cargo build --release --features wgpu-compute

# For CPU-only (no GPU required, slow)
cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start

### Using the run script

```bash
# Run with default config.yaml
./run.sh

# Run with a specific config file
./run.sh my_config.yaml

# Override parameters via environment variables
MAX_EPOCHS=5000 ./run.sh

# Use paths from config.yaml instead of run.sh defaults
USE_CONFIG_DIRS=true ./run.sh
```

### Using the binary directly

```bash
# Generate a default config file
./target/release/energetic-primordial-soup --generate-config

# Run with config file
./target/release/energetic-primordial-soup --config config.yaml

# Run with command-line arguments
./target/release/energetic-primordial-soup \
    --grid-width 512 \
    --grid-height 256 \
    --max-epochs 10000 \
    --energy \
    --energy-sources 4 \
    --energy-radius 64
```

  resume_from: ""               # Path to checkpoint to resume (empty = fresh start)

# Energy system
energy:
  enabled: true
  sources: 6                    # Number of sources (1-8)
  radius: 64                    # Radius of each source

                                # half_circle_bottom, half_circle_left, half_circle_right,
                                # ellipse, ellipse_v, random

    random_placement: true      # Randomize source positions
    max_sources: 10             # Maximum simultaneous sources

    spawn_rate: 5000            # Spawn new source every N epochs (0 = disabled)

  # Per-Simulation Groups (optional)
  # Run different death_epochs across simulations in a single run.
  # Useful for comparing different evolutionary pressures.
  sim_groups:
    - death_epochs: 10000       # 85 sims die after 10k epochs without interaction
      count: 85
    - death_epochs: 100000      # 85 sims die after 100k epochs
      count: 85
    - death_epochs: 0           # 86 sims are immortal (never die from timeout)
      count: 86
```

## Energy System

The energy system adds spatial structure to the simulation:

- **Energy Sources**: Fixed or randomly placed zones on the grid with configurable shapes
- **Mutation Permission**: Only programs within energy zones (or with reserve energy) can mutate
- **Reserve Energy**: Programs leaving an energy zone retain mutation ability for a limited time
- **Death Timer**: Programs outside energy zones that don't interact for too long become inactive (set to 0 for immortal programs)
- **Dynamic Sources**: Sources can spawn, expire, and move over time
- **Spontaneous Generation**: Dead tapes within energy zones can randomly spawn new programs
- **Per-Simulation Variation**: Each parallel simulation gets unique energy field positions
- **Simulation Groups**: Run different death_epochs across simulations for comparative experiments

### Energy Zone Shapes

Available shapes for energy zones:
- `circle` - Standard circular zone
- `strip_h` - Horizontal strip
- `strip_v` - Vertical strip
- `half_circle` - Top half of a circle
- `half_circle_bottom` - Bottom half of a circle
- `half_circle_left` - Left half of a circle
- `half_circle_right` - Right half of a circle
- `ellipse` - Horizontal ellipse
- `ellipse_v` - Vertical ellipse
- `random` - Random shape per source

## Mega-Simulation Mode

When `border_interaction` is enabled, parallel simulations are arranged in a grid where adjacent simulations can interact at their borders:

```yaml
simulation:
  parallel_sims: 256
  parallel_layout: [16, 16]   # 16x16 grid of simulations
  border_interaction: true    # Enable cross-border pairing
```

This creates a single large simulation grid (e.g., 4096x4096 programs for 16x16 layout of 256x256 sims) where programs at simulation edges can pair with programs in adjacent simulations. This enables genetic information to flow across the entire mega-grid.

Cross-border pairs are generated first to ensure edge programs interact with neighbors, then internal pairs fill in the remaining programs.

## Checkpointing

Save and restore complete simulation state:

```yaml
checkpoint:
  enabled: true
  interval: 10000            # Save every 10000 epochs
  path: "checkpoints"
  resume_from: ""            # Set to checkpoint path to resume
```

Checkpoint files contain:
- All program tapes (soup data)
- Energy states (reserve, timer, dead status)
- Current epoch
- Configuration metadata for validation

To resume from a checkpoint:
```yaml
checkpoint:
  resume_from: "checkpoints/checkpoint_epoch_00010000_sims_256.bff"
```

## Raw Data Saving and Post-Processing

For maximum simulation speed, save raw binary data during the run and render frames afterwards:

### During Simulation (Maximum Speed)
```yaml
output:
  frame_interval: 128
  save_raw: true           # Save raw soup data
  async_save: true         # Non-blocking saves
  render_frames: false     # Skip rendering during sim
```

### Post-Simulation Rendering
```bash
# Render frames from saved raw data
./render_frames.sh /path/to/raw_data /path/to/frames

# Or use the binary directly
./target/release/energetic-primordial-soup \
  --render-raw /path/to/raw_data \
  --frames-dir /path/to/frames \
  --config config.yaml
```

Raw data files are compact binary dumps (~16MB for 256 sims at 256x256). The async writer ensures saves happen in a background thread without blocking the GPU.

## Output

The simulation generates:

- **Frames**: PNG, JPEG, or PPM images showing program state (color-coded by byte values)
- **MP4 videos**: Compressed videos created from frames via ffmpeg
- **Log files**: Simulation statistics and progress
- **Checkpoints**: Binary files for resuming simulations
- **Raw data**: Binary soup dumps for post-processing

When running mega-simulations, a combined frame shows all simulations arranged in their grid layout.

## BFF Instruction Set

| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `<` `>` | Move head 0 left/right |
| `{` `}` | Move head 1 left/right |
| `+` `-` | Increment/decrement byte at head 0 |
| `.` | Copy byte from head 0 to head 1 |
| `,` | Copy byte from head 1 to head 0 |
| `[` `]` | Loop (jump if byte at head 0 is zero/non-zero) |

Programs are paired and execute on a combined 128-byte tape (64 bytes from each program).
